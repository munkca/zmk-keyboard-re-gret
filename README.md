# Re-gret Dvorak keymap

Thanks, rschenk. I am attempting to learn how to use both github and zmk at the same time, and figured it must be easier to attain success by copying and modifying something that already works. 
I have used a Dvorak/Miryoku-style layout similar to what I have on my other Hillside QMK keyboard, but am trying out Callum-style mods. After a few weeks use I am still getting used to them, but feel generally positive about the approach. Still, I am fairly used to mod-taps, so on my next keyboard (Tern), I will be implementing urob's timeless mod-taps and seeing how they go for me.
