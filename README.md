Thanks, rschenk. I am attempting to learn how to use both github and zmk at the same time, and figured it must be easier to attain success by copying and modifying something that already works. I intend to modify this with a Dvorak/Miryoku-style layout similar to what I have on my other Hillside QMK keyboard.
